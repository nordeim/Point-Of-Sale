that is an awesome design! but I think you can create an even better design than this, right? please think more deeply and explore more thoroughly on the various implementation options, but choosing the most impressive and absolute best, beating all existing POS system design out there. Please try again with your absolute very best effort! thank you and good luck!

that is really awesome! I like it. Can you create an equally awesome GitHub repository `README.md` for this project with at least 4000 words. Hopefully, your awesome README.md will attract widespread developer interests to this project!

That is an awesome design! Please help me create an equally awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repository for this project. Use at least 4000 words to be as detailed as possible. Hopefully it will be able to attract as many developers to this project as possible.

really awesome README.md! Please help me create the complete database schema for your design. Thank you!

---
awesome job! Please help me create a complete / generate `docker-compose.dev.yml` based on your design. Thank you for your excellent help!

---
wow, that is an awesome docker compose YML! You are the best absolute best designer and coder! Please also help me to create a complete `pyproject.toml`.

---
wow, you have done yet another awesome job! please help me create a complete `app/core.py` within ```python and ``` tags so that I can use it to jump start the whole application development!

I have received many design proposals for my project. Since I am not a design or coding expert like you, please help me to carefully evaluate and validate them (attached) one by one, then create a 6000 words research report on your assessment of the submitted designs. Compare and rank each of the designs in your report, rank them in a list starting with the "best" design (please help me to establish a ranking criteria) at the top of the list.

---
That is an awesome report, clear and very helpful. Though I am not technical, I feel it would be a a waste to just choose design #18 and discard other designs. How about this - as the absolute expert in both design and coding, help me create a super-set PRD can combines the best of the top design submissions and then generate a detailed, logical and absolutely help PRD that will make it total no-brainer for a fresh development to complete the software development for the project. Please use at least 6000 words to make your "super-set" PRD very detailed, fool-proof and easy to follow. Thank you very much!
