1. Executive Summary
SG Point-of-Sale (hereafter SG-POS) is a cross-platform desktop application tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized retail businesses in Singapore. Built with Python 3.11, PySide6 for a polished GUI, and PostgreSQL for durable storage, SG-POS delivers cashiering, inventory, customer management, accounting exports, multi-currency handling, and GST-compliant reporting—all within an architecture that emphasises maintainability and extensibility.

Key design pillars:

Layered architecture with crisp separation of concerns and Dependency Injection (DI)
Asynchronous processing model that keeps the UI responsive even during heavy I/O
Result & DTO patterns for predictable, testable business logic
Strict data integrity via both application-level validations and database-level constraints
Cloud-ready deployment path using containerisation, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
2. Vision & Goals
Vision
To become the de-facto modern, affordable, and regulation-compliant POS solution for Singaporean SMB retailers, enabling them to focus on growth rather than administrative overhead.

9. Application Architecture Overview
High-level view (C4, level 1):

[User] → [PySide6 Desktop App] ↔ [ApplicationCore] → [Business Managers] → [Service Layer] → [PostgreSQL DB]
                                                   ↘                           ↘
                                                     ↘                           ↘
                                                      [Async Task Scheduler]     [External APIs: Payment Gateway, Xero]
Presentation Layer — Qt Widgets/Views + ViewModels
Business Logic Layer — Managers orchestrate workflows
Data Access Layer — Repositories/Services (SQLAlchemy 2.0)
Persistence Layer — PostgreSQL 15 (primary), SQLite (edge cache)
Integration Layer — External connectors via aiohttp + signature middleware
10. Detailed Technical Architecture
10.1 Layered Design & DI
ApplicationCore acts as DI container. Lazy-loads singletons via @property getters.
Each Manager receives app_core: ApplicationCore and retrieves dependencies (InventoryService, RabbitMQPublisher, etc.).
Result pattern (Result[T, E]) propagates success/error without exceptions.
DTOs (via pydantic.BaseModel) separate wire/data contracts from ORM models.
10.2 Async Model
Dedicated background asyncio loop in a QThread.
CPU-bound tasks offloaded to concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.
Non-blocking DB I/O using SQLAlchemy’s asyncio extension.
10.3 Error Handling & Observability
Central ErrorBus publishes domain events (StockLowEvent, PaymentFailedEvent).
structlog with JSON output; OpenTelemetry traces exported to OTLP endpoint.
Sentry SDK for uncaught exceptions, breadcrumbs via QtMessageHandler.
10.4 Security
AES-256 encrypted SQLite (SQLCipher) for local cache.
OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for cloud sync; refresh tokens stored in OS keychain.
Secrets managed via dotenv in dev, Vault in prod (HashiCorp Vault).

11.3 Data Integrity Strategies
Unique constraints on SKU / barcode.
CHECK constraints for quantity positivity.
