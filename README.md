> **SG-POS** is a **modern, offline-first, fully-featured Point-of-Sale (POS) application** designed specifically for the regulatory and day-to-day realities of the Singapore retail ecosystem. Built in Python 3.11 with a blazing-fast Qt 6 interface, backed by rock-solid PostgreSQL, and architected around asynchronous, test-driven design principles, SG-POS is **open-source**, **community-driven**, and **ready for production** from day one.

## 1  Why SG-POS?

The Point-of-Sale landscape is crowded with closed-source, opaque, and often prohibitively expensive solutions. **SG-POS** was born to flip that paradigm on its head. We believe that *modern retail operations* deserve *modern tooling* built in the open, designed to scale, and tailored to local compliance‚Äîwithout the vendor lock-in or hefty price tag.

* **Singapore-First Compliance** ‚Äì IRAS GST reports, Peppol e-Invoicing, PDPA data-handling guidelines, and multi-currency workflows reflecting regional realities.
* **Developer-Centric Philosophy** ‚Äì Everything‚Äîfrom database migrations to Qt UI forms‚Äîlives in Git, is unit-tested, and is documented. If you can code, you can customise.
* **Offline-First Reliability** ‚Äì Spotty network in your store? SQ-POS seamlessly switches between encrypted SQLite cache and PostgreSQL sync, so you never lose a sale.
* **Extensible, API-Driven Core** ‚Äì Clean, layered architecture using DTOs, Dependency Injection, and the Result pattern means new modules *snap* into place without hacks.
* **Community Over Vendor** ‚Äì We thrive on community pull requests, plugins, and honest feedback loops. Your feature request is a discussion, not a ticket number in a black box.

## 3  Architecture at a Glance

Below is a high-level **C4** Container diagram (Mermaid). For a deep dive, read `/docs/architecture/*.md`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Desktop
        UI[PySide6 GUI] --> Core(ApplicationCore)
    end
    Core -->|Managers| BL[Business Logic]
    BL -->|Services| DAL[Data Access Layer]
    DAL -->|Async ORM| DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    BL -->|HTTP / AMQP| EXT[External APIs]
    UI <-->|Qt Signals| ASYNC[Async Loop]
```

**Key Tenets**

1. **Layered Separation** ‚Äì Presentation, Business Logic, Repository, Database.
2. **Dependency Injection** ‚Äì Lazy-loaded singletons via `ApplicationCore`.
3. **Async-Ahead-of-Time** ‚Äì Background tasks in an `asyncio` loop; UI remains 60 fps.
4. **Result Pattern** ‚Äì Success/Failure typed objects, not exceptions.
5. **DTOs Everywhere** ‚Äì Pydantic models strictly for transport, never leak ORM entities.
